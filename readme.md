# Naval Chess v1.0
- Development period: 2021.1.24~2021.2.5
- Unity version: 2020.2.2f1

## How To Play

Naval Chess is a turn-based, competitive strategy game.
This game requires 2 players with one device (multiplayer is not supported for now).
Before the game starts, please decide who will be team "TOP" or team "BOTTOM".
1. Each player has to buy ship units with limited budget. There are 5 types of unit, and every unit has different features and costs.
2. After both players finalize their team organization, they have to put the pieces on the gameboard.
3. Player can use 4 APs(Action Points) in total on each turn. Every unit can use up to 3 APs on each turn. Consumed APs are restored at the beginning of the player's next turn. Attacking/Moving consumes 1 AP, but one unit can attack only once on a single turn. The order between the actions doesn't matter.
4. To win, you have to do either one of the following:
- eliminate all enemy units before your opponent does so
- place a unit on the far end of the opposite side
- destroy your opponent's base (can be done with a single shot)
